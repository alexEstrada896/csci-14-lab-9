1. (5 pts) Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is the rectangle's length times its width. The program should prompt the user to enter the length and width of two rectangles (A and B). Its output should tell the user which rectangle has the greater area, or if the areas are the same. 

Sample output (different areas):

Rectangle A has an area of 9. Rectangle B has an area of 16. Rectangle B has a greater area than Rectangle A.
Sample output (same area):

Rectangle A has an area of 9. Rectangle B has an area of 9. Their areas are the same.

2. (5 pts) Write a program that works as a change-counting game. It gets the user to enter the number of coins required to make exactly one dollar. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of pennies (1-cent coins), nickels (5-cent coins), dimes (10-cent coins), and quarters (25-cent coins). If the total value of the coins entered is equal to a dollar (100-cent coin), the program should congratulate the user for wining the game. Otherwise, the program should display a message indicating whether the amount entered was more than or less than one dollar.  

Sample output (winning):

Congratulations you won! You entered 0 pennies, 10 nickels, 0 dimes, and 2 quarters. They make exactly one dollar!
Sample output (not winning):

You entered 1 pennies, 10 nickels, 1 dimes, and 2 quarters. The amount you entered was more than one dollar.
